|'g:clighter_window_size'|		Window size for highlighting
|'g:clighter_clang_options'|		The Compile options for Clang

<

						*'clighter_window_size'*
g:clighter_window_size~
Clighter uses vim's regular expression(RE) engine to do syntax highlighting,
but the RE engine performs not well while there are too many RE rules. To get
the better performance, Clighter can highlights a given region(window) instead
of whole buffer.
	
`<0`: highlight whole buffer.

`>=0`: highlight from top line number reduce 100 * clighter_window_size to
bottom line number plug 100 * clighter_window_size of screen.

Default: `1`
>
	let g:clighter_window_size = -1 " whole buffer
	let g:clighter_window_size = 0 " highlight current screen of window
<

this path.

Default: `''`
>
	let g:clighter_libclang_file = '/usr/lib/libclang.so'
<
						*'clighter_realtime'*
g:clighter_realtime~
Do syntax highlighting in realtime. Turn off this option may improve the
performance.

Default: `1`
>
	let g:clighter_realtime = 1
<
g:clighter_rename_prompt_level~
The prompt level of rename refactoring.

`0`: no prompt

>
	let g:clighter_rename_prompt_level = 1
<

g:clighter_enable_cross_rename~
`0`: disable
`1`: enable

Default: `1`

						*clighter-commands*
Clighter provides command to control it

Enable Clighter's syntax highlight engine~
>
	ClighterEnable
<

Disable Clighter's syntax highlight engine~
Notice that is will not disable the cursor highlighting.
>
	ClighterDisable
<

Toggle cursor highlighting~
>
	ClighterToggleCursorHL
<
Rename-refactor the variable/function name under vim cursor~
	* It's a experimental function and maybe not reliable
	* It's not project based(only processes the files that have been
	  opened in vim's buffer list already)
	* Stronglly recommend that backing up all files before using this
	  function.
>
	clighter#Rename()
<
    	For convenience, you can add this key map:
>
    	nmap <silent> <Leader>r :call clighter#Rename()<CR>
>

						*clighter-colors*
6. Customize Colors~

Clighter defines the following syntax group corresponding to CursorKing of
Clang.

clighterMacroInstantiation~
>
	hi link clighterMacroInstantiation Constant
>

clighterTypeRef~
>
	hi link clighterTypeRef Identifier
>

clighterStructDecl~
>
	hi link clighterStructDecl Type
>

clighterClassDecl~
>
	hi link clighterClassDecl Type
>

clighterEnumDecl~
>
	hi link clighterEnumDecl Type
>

clighterEnumConstantDecl~
>
	hi link clighterEnumConstantDecl Identifier
>

clighterDeclRefExprEnum~
>
	hi link clighterDeclRefExprEnum Identifier

clighterCursorDefRef~
>
	hi link clighterCursorDefRef Search

You can customize these colors in your colorscheme, for example:

7. FAQ

Q. The clighter plugin doesn't work.
A. Vim version 7.4+ with python2.x is required, and make sure libclang(3.5 is
recommended) is installed correctly and set g:clighter_libclang_file if need.

Q. Why rename-refactoring function is an experimental function
A. Even though libclang provides many useful informations, it's not enough to
do cross file rename-refactoring, so Clighter needs to use its own way way to
'guess' what should be renamed. Clighter can't gurantee the result of
rename-factoring result is perfect.
