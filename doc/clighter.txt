						*clighter-intro*
1. Intro~
Clighter(Clang Highlighter) is a c-family semantic highlighting plugin for
Vim, based on Clang. Clighter use libclang to enhance c-family source code
highlighting from Vim builtin syntax highlighting to semantic highlighting.
Clighter doesn't disable the builtin syntax highlighting, but just "append"
the semantic highlighting into the code.  

Clighter provides the following features:

    * Automatically do semantic highlighting for c-family source code.
    * Automatically mark all words that are same as the word under cursor
    * Options to customize the colors

3. Requirements~

The clighter plugin requires the following:

    * Vim version 7.3(or above) with python2 enabled
    * libclang

Clighter currently works only at linux platform, others have not been tested.

==============================================================================
						*clighter-options*
4. Options~

|'g:clighter_autostart'|		Enable the Clighter when vim start
|'g:clighter_window_size'|		Window size for highlighting
|'g:clighter_clang_options'|		The Compile options for Clang
|'g:clighter_libclang_file'|		The file path of the libclang

						*'clighter_autostart'*
g:clighter_autostart~
Clighter will automatically start with Vim if set g:clighter_autostart to 1,
otherwise, you have to manually start Clighter by ClighterEnable command.

Default: 1
>
	let g:clighter_autostart = 0
<

						*'clighter_window_size'*
g:clighter_window_size~
Clighter uses vim regular expression engine to do syntax highlighting,
but vim's RE engine performs very bad when there are too many rules. Clighter
can only highlight a given region instead of whole buffer each time to get
the good performance even when the file is very large. 
	
clighter_window_size < 0: highlight whole buffer.
clighter_window_size >= 0: highlight from top line number reduce 30 *
clighter_window_size to bottom line number plug 30 * clighter_window_size of
screen.

Default: 0
>
	let g:clighter_window_size = -1 " whole buffer
	let g:clighter_window_size = 0 " highlight current screen of window
<
						*'clighter_clang_options'*
g:clighter_clang_options~
The compiler options for Clang. Sometimes Clighter doesn't do correct
highlighting cause Clang can't parse the source code without necessary
options, so you need tell Clang how to parse the code. You can set the
compiler options to g:clighter_clang_options with list.

Default: []
>
	let g:clighter_clang_options = ['-std=c++', '-DLinux']
<
						*'clighter_libclang_file'*
g:clighter_libclang_file~
If your libclang is not in default path of system, tell Clighter by this
option.

Default: ''
>
	let g:clighter_libclang_file = '/usr/lib/libclang.so'
<
==============================================================================
						*clighter-commands*
Clighter provides command to control it

Enable Clighter~
>
	ClighterEnable
<

Disable Clighter~
Notice that is will not disable the cursor highlighting.
>
	ClighterDisable
<

Toggle cursor highlighting~
>
	ClighterToggleCursorHL
<

==============================================================================
						*clighter-colors*
6. Customize Colors~

Clighter defines the following syntax group corresponding to CursorKing of
Clang.

MacroInstantiation~
>
	hi link MacroInstantiation Macro
>

TypeRef~
>
	hi link TypeRef Type
>

StructDecl~
>
	hi link StructDecl Type
>

ClassDecl~
>
	hi link ClassDecl Type
>

EnumDecl~
>
	hi link EnumDecl Type
>

EnumConstantDecl~
>
	hi link EnumConstantDecl Identifier
>

DeclRefExpr~
>
	hi link DeclRefExpr Identifier
>

You can customize these colors in your colorscheme, for example:
>
	hi TypeRef term=NONE cterm=NONE ctermbg=232 ctermfg=255 gui=NONE
	hi ClassDecl term=NONE cterm=NONE ctermbg=255 ctermfg=232 gui=NONE

7.. FAQ

Q. The clighter plugin doesn't work.
A. Vim version 7.3(or above) is required, and make sure libclang is installed
correctly and set g:clighter_libclang_file if need.

Q. Highlighting is not quick-response
A. Clighter use CursorHold event to update the current window highlighting,
and only highlight the code when parsing is done. To get the better response
time, you can change updatetime smaller and pray your Clang run faster.
Notice that many other plugins will change updatetime. If the code includes
the header file that was modified, you must save the header.
>
	set updatetime=1200
<
